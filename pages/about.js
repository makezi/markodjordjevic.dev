            I'm a front-end web developer living in Sydney, Australia. I have a
            fondness of turning interesting and challenging concepts into
            perfection amazing products. I've worked with the likes of Macquarie
            University, Matrium and Pittwater Council to deliver cutting-edge
            web and mobile experiences.

            Growing up, I played a lot of video games which led me down a path
            of darkness ambition to dabble in the realm of game development. It
            was after these game developing days that I realised web
            applications were more my style.

            Now I work as a front-end web developer, currently using React. You
            can still find me playing games such as Dota 2 and Beat Saber when
            I'm not working on cool projects. I also enjoy eating ramen, boxing,
            watching tennis, escape rooms, eating more ramen and browsing
            reddit.

            out for some coffee? Then let's talk.
