If you've ever tried to use Auth0 as your authentication service in a Next.js
project, you would have been directed to use Auth0's `nextjs-auth0` library.
However, even though it handles everything an authentication service needs to
handle, it falls short in one aspect: fetching the user metadata of a user.
Unfortunately, it seems that this outside the scope of this module:
[nextjs-auth0](https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0/issues/45).

## Why is this important?

The user metadata is used to store the user's preferences when using your
application. This could be for instance, a boolean flag that indicates if the
user wishes to receive email/SMS notifications:

```json
"user_metadata": {
  "notifications_enabled": 1
}
```

In one particular case of an application I was working, the application was an
ecommerce shop in which user's can select a specific store to retrieve
deliveries from. We would store their selected store as `store_id` in which our
API's would use later on.

Allowing users to receive this information on login is critical as the rest of
the application depended on it, i.e. showing products from that specific store
on load/server side.

Auth0 suggests reading user's metadata via [auth0 rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/metadata).
However, in the previous case, this is an issue as the rules are only ran AFTER
([https://auth0.com/docs/rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules)) the user has
authenticated/logged in for the first time. This means that this data isn't
available to the user on their first login after signup for example - they
would need to relog back in for the rule to run and append their user metadata
to the access token/json response.

So how would we go about solving this? The solution is to attach a middleware to
the API route that's fetching the user profile (if following along
`nextjs-auth0` tutorial, it would be under `/pages/api/me.js`).

## Configure management api/scopes?

Need this section first?

## Adding a middleware

We can wrap nextjs api routes with a middleware which modifies the
request/response handler, similar to that of a higher order function.

**CODE SAMPLE HERE**

The middleware needs to do the following:

1. Check to see if a valid user session exists and if so, get their access token
2. Using said access token, retrieve their user's metadata via the Auth0
   Management API. This can be done via the `node-auth0` library or the
   Management API URL directly.

- NOTE: need to check user scopes

```js
const MANAGEMENT_API_URL = `https://${process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN}/api/v2`;

async function me(req, res) {
  // Omitted ...
}

function withUserMetadata(handler) {
  return async (req, res) => {
    try {
      // First we need to get the user JSON response to be merged with
      // user_metadata JSON
      const userJson = res.json;

      // Retrieve the user access token via valid session
      const session = await auth0.getSession(req);
      const { accessToken, user } = session;

      // DO OTHER CODE
    } catch (error) {}
  };
}
```

## Conclusion

Although not officially supported in the `nextjs-auth0` library, we still 
managed to retrieve the `user_metadata` via Auth0's management API via API 
middlewares. Hopefully this helps! Good luck!
