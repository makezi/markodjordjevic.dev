If you've ever tried to use Auth0 as your authentication service in Next.js
project, you would have been directed to use Auth0's `nextjs-auth0` library.
However, even though it handles everything an authentication service needs to
handle, it falls short in one aspect: fetching the user metadata of a user.
Unfortunately, it seems that this is outside the scope of this
[module](https://www.notion.so/How-to-fetch-user-metadata-from-Auth0-in-Next-js-3652b7069d5e4d9fa0dfa2327accec21#0a111047f0804133938938f0f1860f76)

## Why is this important?

The user metadata is used to store the user's preferences when using your
application. This could be for instance, a boolean flag that indicates if the
user wishes to receive email/SMS notifications:

```json
"user_metadata": {
  "notifications_enabled": 1
}
```

## Adding a middleware

```js
const MANAGEMENT_API_URL = `https://${process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN}/api/v2`;

async function me(req, res) {
  // Omitted ...
}

function withUserMetadata(handler) {
  return async (req, res) => {
    try {
      // First we need to get the user JSON response to be merged with
      // user_metadata JSON
      const userJson = res.json;

      // Retrieve the user access token via valid session
      const session = await auth0.getSession(req);
      const { accessToken, user } = session;

      // DO OTHER CODE
    } catch (error) {}
  };
}
```
